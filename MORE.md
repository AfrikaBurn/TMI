# TMI: A participant centric toolset

![Ecosystem](./docs/svg/Ecosystem.svg)


## What's in the box?

Each tool, a complete open source project on its own, is arranged in four
categories around each participant:


### Access

The tribe is made accessible through the Web, Wiki and Tokens.
Tokens may include logins, subscriptions, sponsorships or gifts.


### Personae

Each participant radically expresses themselves through social, audio, video and streams
personae.


### Bio

A participant builds social capital by investing in the community through
participation. Their bio is a testament to that in their learning, teaching,
decision making and volunteering within the community.


### Projects

A participant captures ideas in the Cloud; these ideas turn into projects to be
managed. Within the same system assets related to the projects are able to be
inventoried and maintenance schedules introduced.
