# TMI Context

Burns are social experiments where participants create a temporary town where
there was none. The experiment enables and experience that is created through
participants contributing artworks, theme camps, mutant vehicles, performances
and infrastructure.

Each project is a daunting undertaking requiring months of
planning, organisation, logistics, labour, administration and coordination.


Projects need to register to qualify for placement within the temporary town,
being published online and within the Where To Find guide and to be able to
qualify and apply for creative grants.

Participants within projects need to communicate, coordinate and share workload.
The organisation provides infrastructure, integrates these projects and
facilitates intra project collaboration.

## Insights

### Connection centric

At the core of a community is its participants, the collectives they form and information they share.

### Universal tool set

The same toolset the organisation requires to organise the festival is required by participants to organise their own projects.
Just as the organisation coordinates volunteers, events and projects, so does the community within their own projects.

### Profile proliferation

These collectives have classifiable purpose expressed through profiles.

Membership to collectives require specialised information that may also be expressed through profiles.

Profiles may include Artworks in the case of Collectives; Ranger profile in the case of participants.


### A community fundamentally depends on forging agreements

Each project registration, volunteer participation and any association or membership is based on some form of agreement.

Agreements exist between members of a collective, between collectives and between participants.

These agreements represent the connections between participants, participants and collectives as well as between collectives.

Examples of these agreements may include project registrations in the case of collectives; Ranger code of conduct in the case of participants.
