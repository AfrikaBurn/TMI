### Visitor

* As a visitor, I would like to create an account so I may interact with participants and collectives, create and register projects, and gain access to tickets.
Ideally I should be added to a default AfrikaBurn collective on registration.
* As a visitor, I would like to update my account so that my details are up to date. Ideally the system should remind me before a ticket sale.

* As a visitor, I would like to be able to log in so that I may use the toolset. Ideally the system should be able to remember me and log me in automatically.
* As a visitor I would like to be able to retrieve my password so that I may access the toolset even when I have forgotten my details. Ideally the system should ask security questions or details to verify me.


### Participant

* As a participant I would like to be able to view my agreements, so that I may be able to see which collectives I belong to, which projects I have created and registered, and whatever other agreements like codes of conduct I have agreed to. Ideally the system should make it easy for me to view these based on projects, collectives and individuals.
* as a participant I would like to be able to consent to agreements so that I may join collectives, become an administrator of collectives, manage my privacy, become a ranger, DPW member etc. Ideally the system should prepopulate these from existing information from my profiles.
* As a participant I would like to be able to log out so that I may use the system on public computers in a secure manner. Ideally the system should ask whether I am using a public, computer and log me out automatically on those.
* As a participant I would like to create collectives so that I may effectively group my communication with other participants, create and register projects, have discussions and plan and collaborate effectively.
* As a participant I would like to be able to contact a collective so that I may gather information that will help me decide whether I would like to join the collective. Ideally the system would forward such communication to all admins.
* As a participant I would like to be able to message another participant so that we may exchance information in a private forum. Ideally the system would alert the recipient.


### Group member

* As a member I would like to manage my privacy so that I may control what information I share with other members and the admins of a collective. Ideally the system should make it easy for me to get an overview of what information I share site wide.
* As a member I would like to leave a collective so that I am no longer a member, no longer receive notifications and stop collaborating with the other members. Ideally my details shared with the collective should be unshared when I leave.
* As a member I would like to be able to post to a collective so that I may share information with the collective members. Ideally the system should allow for the collective to control who may post in a collective.


### Group moderator

* As a moderator I would like to be able to edit a collective so that the collective information, privacy and project capabilities may change. Ideally the members would be alerted to such changes.
* As a moderator I would like to be able to moderate content so that the group content may remain respectful and relevant. Ideally members should be able to alert moderators of questionable content.
* As a moderator I would like to be able to approve or decline membership so that the membership may be curated. Ideally the system should alert all moderators on membership requests.
* As a moderator I would like to be able to remove and block members so that the integrity of the group may be maintained. Ideally all the moderators should be alerted to such action.
* As a moderator I would like to be able to create or update agreements types so that the I may customise the requirements and roles of group members. Ideally the system would have default agreements for membership, moderatorship, administratorship, project registration, crew application and registration as well as NDAs and codes of conduct.
