# Tribe Mobilisation Infrastructure

An ecosystem of online tools to nurture, protect and empower its participants:

* **Create**, **Find** and **Share** resources.
* **Catalise**, **Collaborate** on and **Achieve** projects.
* **Collect**, **Expand** and **Promote** knowledge.
* **Cultivate**, **Educate** and **Inspire** people.
* **Dream**, **Determine** and **Realise** a future.


## The Tools

Each tool, a complete open source project on it's own, is arranged in four 
categories around every participant:

### Access

The online tribe is made accessible through the Web, Wiki and Tokens. Examples 
of tokens may include user authentication, event tickets, subscriptions or donations.

### Personae

express themselves radically through Chat, video conference Huddles and 
audio/visual Streams.

### Bio

A participant builds social capital by how they invest in the community through 
participation. Their bio is a testament of that investment. How civically 
responsible they are by teaching, Learning, participation in Decisions and 
Volunteering within their community.
