## The Tools

Each tool, a complete open source project on its own, is arranged in four 
categories around each participant:

### Bio

A participant builds social capital by investing in the community through 
participation. Their bio is a testament to that in their learning, teaching, 
decision making and volunteering within the community.

### Projects

A participant captures ideas in the Cloud; these ideas turn into projects to be 
managed. Within the same system assets related to the projects are able to be 
inventoried and maintenance schedules introduced.
