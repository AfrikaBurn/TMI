# Learning component


This component partially satisfies the following aspects of the 
[Web requirements](https://github.com/AfrikaBurn/TMI/blob/master/docs/\
requirements.md#web):


### Visitor

* As a visitor I would like to complete training programs so that I may 
acculturate. Ideally successful completion would create an account, enable 
access to event tickets and additional systems within TMI.


### Participant

* As a participant I would like to complete training programs so that I may 
learn new skills. Ideally these programs could unlock additional permissions, 
system functionality-, collaboration- and groups


### Editor

* As an editor I would like to compose training programs so that I may teach 
other participants and visitors new skills and help acculturate participants. 
Ideally the system would allow for triggers to allow the system to enable access 
to additional functionality, groups and collaboration.
