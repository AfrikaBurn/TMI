# Decide


## Requirements

Loomio partially satisfies the following aspects of the 
[Project requirements](https://github.com/AfrikaBurn/TMI/blob/master/docs/\
requirements.md#projects):


### Visitor

* ~~As a visitor I would like to be able to view projects so that I may get an idea of the types of projects that is being realised within the system. Ideally the system should show past, present and planned projects that are set to be publically visible.~~
* ~~As a visitor I would like to be able to search projects so that I may be able to see the kind of projects I may be interested in.~~
* ~~As a participant I would like to be able to message a project so that~~ I may gather additional information or contribute to the project. Ideally the system would alert moderators of the project.


### Project lead

* As a project lead I would like to be able to create/update projects so that I may be able to engage with other participants to collaborate and share workload in realising a project. Ideally the system would provide tools to allow better collaboration.
* ~~As a project lead I would like to register projects so that I may publicise my intent to bring a project to an event, gain access to funding, collaboration and mentoring from an event organiser. Ideally the system would prepopulate as much information as possible from the project into the registration.~~
* ~~As a project lead I would like to be able to upvote project registrations as part of the grant process so that I may show support for the funding efforts of projects. Ideally the system would allow all participating projects to vote.~~


### Project Wrangler

* ~~As a wrangler I would like to be able to administer projects so that I may be able to curate and publicise which projects are attending the event as well as assign grant allocations.~~ Ideally the system would facilitate creating reports.
